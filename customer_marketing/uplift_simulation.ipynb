    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides the code used to generate synthetic data that forms the subject of the marketing case study assessment in the FEAT Fairness Principles Assessment Case Studies Document (Dec 2020). Please see Section 2.3 of that document for the assessment itself. This code is not intended for use in production or for assessing high risk AIDA systems under the methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code to perform the marketing case study assessment is also in this repository, in \"assessment_input.ipynb\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This work was undertaken as part of the Veritas initiative commissioned by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, whose goal is to accelerate the adoption of responsible Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (AIDA) in the financial services industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "_The following is a running example of a hypothetical, simulated, AIDA direct marketing system used for marketing unsecured loans. Please note that this running example:_ \n",
    "- _is evaluated at a high level of detail to illustrate the Methodology applied to a higher risk system_\n",
    "- _is an example assessment of a system determined by a fictional Financial Services Institution (FSI) to be higher risk, not guidance for FSIs on the actual risk associated with this example (for more details on the risk-based approach of the Methodology see Document 1 Section 2)_\n",
    "- _is intended to be a simple illustration of how to use the Methodology_\n",
    "- _does not represent any AIDA systems in place at any of the Veritas Consortium members_\n",
    "- _should not be taken as guidance for any context- or value-sensitive decision such as choices of fairness objectives, measures, or personal attributes_\n",
    "- _is not intended to constrain the scope of the Methodology: other uses may have different interventions, products, objectives, and use of AIDA systems_\n",
    "- _uses simulated data that is not intended to depict realistic statistical relationships or performance measures_\n",
    "- _has omitted some analyses for the sake of brevity (for example, those relating to harms from default)_\n",
    "\n",
    "_The terms “we”, “us” or “our” in the running example refer to the functional author of the assessment and not to members of the Consortium as elsewhere in this document._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A (fictional) FSI with a new unsecured “fast & simple” loan product would like to embark on a marketing campaign to its existing (non-exempt) customer base. The FSI will make a profit from the interest rate payments of this product, but this profit will be offset by the cost of the marketing campaign that is carried out through a call centre operated by a different subsidiary company. The purpose of the marketing system under analysis is to select existing customers for a marketing call to increase sales of the product.\n",
