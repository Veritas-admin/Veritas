# Phase 1 Code Repository


This repository contains code for Phase 1 of Project Veritas. Currently, this code
applies the FEAT Fairness Assessment Methodology to fictional AIDA systems in two use cases.

- For the *credit scoring* use case, see the `credit scoring` folder.
- For the *customer marketing* use case, see the `customer_marketing` folder.

NOTE: This is an initial upload of the Phase 1 code. The final version will
have the two case-studies integregated with a unified set of installation
instructions etc.
